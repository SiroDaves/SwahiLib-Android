    "They come from the East and West,\nThey come from the lands afar,\nTo feast with the King, to dine as\nHis guest\nHow Blessed these pilgrims are!\nBeholding His hallowed face\nAglow with light divine;\nBlest partakers of His grace,\nAs gems in His crown to shine.',",
    "CHORUS\nSince Jesus has set me free,\nI’m happy as heart can be;\nNo longer I bear the burden of care,\nHis yoke is so sweet to me,\nMy soul was as black as night,\nBut darkness has taken flight;\nNow I shout the victory,\nFor Jesus has set me free.",
    "I look on the great white throne,\nBefore it the ransom’d stand;\nNo longer are tears, no sorrow is known\nNor death in that goodly land.\nMy Saviour has gone before,\nPreparing the way for me;\nSoon we’ll meet to part to more\nThru’ time or eternity.",
    "The gates of that holy place\nStand open by night and day;\nO look to the Lord  who  'giveth more grace,'\nWhose love has prepared the way.\nA home in those mansions fair\nHis hand hath reserved for all.\nFor the wedding feast prepare,\nObeying the gracious call.",
    "Oh Jesus is coming soon,\nOur trials will then be o’er\nWhat if our Lord this moment should come\nFor those who are free from sin?\nThen would it bring you joy,\nOr sorrow and deep despair?\nWhen our Lord in glory comes,\nWe’ll meet Him up in the air."
